# Unexpected Aggregation Results in MongoDB

This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines that leads to unexpected or inaccurate results.  The issue stems from an incorrectly constructed pipeline, causing incorrect data processing.  The solution showcases how to correct the pipeline to achieve accurate results.

## Bug

The initial aggregation pipeline (found in `bug.js`) contains a flaw in its structure, causing the query to return results that do not accurately reflect the data in the collection. The specific error and its correction are detailed in the code comments.

## Solution

The corrected aggregation pipeline (in `bugSolution.js`) rectifies the problem by modifying the pipeline stages and operators to produce the intended outcome.  The code includes clear explanations of the modifications made to address the error.
